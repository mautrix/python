        Args:
            alias_localpart: The desired room alias **local part**. If this is included, a room
                alias will be created and mapped to the newly created room. The alias will belong on
                the same homeserver which created the room. For example, if this was set to "foo"
                and sent to the homeserver "example.com" the complete room alias would be
                ``#foo:example.com``.
            visibility: A ``public`` visibility indicates that the room will be shown in the
                published room list. A ``private`` visibility will hide the room from the published
                room list. Defaults to ``private``. **NB:** This should not be confused with
                ``join_rules`` which also uses the word ``public``.
            preset: Convenience parameter for setting various default state events based on a
                preset. Defaults to private (invite-only).
            name: If this is included, an ``m.room.name`` event will be sent into the room to
                indicate the name of the room. See `Room Events`_ for more information on
                ``m.room.name``.
            topic: If this is included, an ``m.room.topic`` event will be sent into the room to
                indicate the topic for the room. See `Room Events`_ for more information on
                ``m.room.topic``.
            is_direct: This flag makes the server set the ``is_direct`` flag on the
                `m.room.member`_ events sent to the users in ``invite`` and ``invite_3pid``. See
                `Direct Messaging`_ for more information.
            invitees: A list of user IDs to invite to the room. This will tell the server to invite
                everyone in the list to the newly created room.
            initial_state: A list of state events to set in the new room. This allows the user to
                override the default state events set in the new room. The expected format of the
                state events are an object with type, state_key and content keys set.

                Takes precedence over events set by ``is_public``, but gets overriden by ``name`` and
                ``topic keys``.
            room_version: The room version to set for the room. IF not provided, the homeserver will
                use its configured default.
            creation_content: Extra keys, such as ``m.federate``, to be added to the `m.room.create`
                event. The server will ignore ``creator`` and ``room_version``. Future versions of
                the specification may allow the server to ignore other keys.

        Returns:
            The ID of the newly created room.

        Raises:
            MatrixResponseError: If the response does not contain a ``room_id`` field.
